## Hi! My name is Robbe 👋

😄 I am an information security professional driven by a genuine passion for my work. My focus lies in cloud security, Microsoft technology, blue/purple teaming, and the powerful MITRE ATT&CK framework. I like to share my knowledge via various community contributions, and share my technical deep dives on [HybridBrothers](https://hybridbrothers.com).
